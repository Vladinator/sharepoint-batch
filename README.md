# SharePointBatch
Inspiration drawn from this article:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn903506.aspx

This Javascript library is supposed to help developers efficiently build batch jobs and parsing the response from the server. The reason I made this was that the existing code provided by Microsoft seemed a bit underwhelming and too specific, while there is a need for a more general library that everyone could use in their projects.

## Compatibility
Tested with Office 365 running SharePoint 2013 SP1 with the following browsers:
- Chrome 45
- Firefox 40
- Internet Explorer 11
- Opera 32
- Safari 5

## Dependencies
No external libraries are required.

## Examples
You can find these appended at the end of the batch.js script. These are of course stripped from batch.min.js
